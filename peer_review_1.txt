You begin to go study at your favorite cafe. Eventually, you stop constantly people watching, it's not like you'll suddenly gain the courage to ask a stranger for their number... 
But you keep going back. At least you are always greeted with bobtwo's sweet smile. After a couple of times of fun banter, bobtwo invited you for coffee, but without the coffee and cream splashed apron.

Hanging around bobtwo makes you're days feel fuller, keeps your mind occupied, and makes time go by fast!

bob has become very career driven, with the support of their partner, they're more confident than ever.

Others must notice too, since bob's coworkers always make sure to invite their favorite work buddy to after-work drinks!
One of your coworkers, Sam, invited you to drinks tonight! But it seems no one has been talking about it. Is it just going to be you two?

.....enter any character to continue:....
bob
Feeling the mix of after-work exhaustion, and the couple of drinks already in your system, you and sam decide to call it a night.
After splitting the check and wrapping up the final laughs of the night, you feel relaxed and replenished.
There's something familiar about this feeling. Walking next to Sam in the cool, dark night makes you forget about the pressures of a proffessional career.
Reminds you of the freedom of college life. 
Lost in thought, you don't realize you've already arrived at Sam's apartment.
Sam thanks you for walking them home and invites you in from some more drinks!
Sam: 'No reason to end the night now! Wanna come in?' 
(yes or no)
no

Sam:  'Oh, are you sure? It might be dangerous for you to go home like this. You can just go home tomorrow. You don't want to?' 
 (yes or no)
no

Sam: Alright. Have a goodnight :)

You go home to your wonderfully supportive and loving partner. But bobtwo is confused as to why you went out today, its not the usual day you drink with all your coworkers. 
Do you choose to tell her the truth about who you went out with? 
(yes or no)
yes

 You decided to tell bobtwo the truth. Theres a hint of betrayal that flashes across their face, but it fades into a dark, thoughtful expression.
The next couple hours are spent by the two of you playing emotional-catch-up.You realize you shouldn't have even accepted your coworkers invitation when you found out it was just for you, and you promise to be more considerate. 
You both realize you've been a bit disconnected lately, but the rest of the night only strengthens and confirms the love you started from. 

Communication can be powerful.
